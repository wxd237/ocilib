2010-11-10 Version 3.8.1 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Fixed UTF8 support using NLS_LANG environment variable set to any UTF8 values

      - Writing/reading lob using OCI_LobRead2() and OCI_LobWrite2()
      - Allocating internal memory for ROWID and UROWID

    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Fixed internal computation of OCI_Object attributes null indicator offsets
      - Fixed OCI_Elem handle initialization by OCI_CollGetAt() and OCI_CollGetAt2()
      - Fixed OCI_Ping() : OCI symbol OCIPing() was not dynamically loaded if OCI_IMPORT_RUNTIME was used (default for precompiled MS Windows Dlls)
      - Fixed memory leak : in case of an unsuccessfull attempt to create a connection, an OCI internal handle was not freed since v3.7.0
      - Fixed OCI_LongWrite()   + OCI_CHARSET_WIDE charset mode : internal length passed to internal OCI calls was expressed in chars instead of bytes
      - Fixed OCI_TypeInfoGet() + OCI_TYF_TYPE : an Oracle error was raised when passing as type name a builtin system type like "SYS.RAW"
      - Fixed OCI_GetLastError() that could return NULL when errors occured in OCI_FetchXXX() calls (although the global error handler was correctly fired) 

    * Miscellaneous changes

      - Added support for numeric subtypes in OCI_BindGetSubtype() + documentation update
      - Manual update of source code formatted with Uncrustify (wrong indentation of witch case and some variable initialization)
      - Pre built MS Windows 32/64bits Dlls are now built using MS Visual Studio 2010 Express (instead of MS Visual Studio 2008 Professional)
      - A MS Visual Studio 2010 Express solution and project has been added to the Windows package to rebuild the Dlls
