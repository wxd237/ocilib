    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Fixed OCI_CollAssign() that was assigning destination collection to source collection
      - Fixed missing const qualifier in some Direct Path functions prototypes	
      - Fixed OCI_ElemSetXXX() for numeric types that was returning FALSE for local collection
      - Fixed PL/SQL tables binds for non scalar types (wrong values handled since v3.2.0)
      - Fixed possible infinite recursivity when calling some OCI_ErrorGetXXX() calls within an error handler at OCILIB initialization
      - Fixed Error message if Oracle shared lib was not found : libray name was not correct on unicode builds
      - Fixed OCI_GetString() : in mixed charset builds, the returned string was truncated for numeric columns 
      - Fixed internal function OCI_MoveString() for inplace string buffers packing/expansion
      - Fixed in/out or string binds :
        * wide string binds on Unixes platforms (Mixed and Unicode builds) : the trailing null character was missing if the binded string had been shortened by some PL/SQL code or user
        * bind indicator is now not reset to "not null" after an execute call if the statement is PL/SQL code
