        - Added OCI_SetNullStringMode()
        - Added OCI_GetNullStringMode()

      - It's now possible to set how string lengths are compute (bytes or characters)
    
        - Added OCI_SetStringLengthMode()
        - Added OCI_GetStringLengthMode()

      - fixed various problems of RAW and LONG handling in OCI_MIXED_CHARSET mode
      - fixed OCI_ServerGetOutput() when statements are reprepared
      - fixed computation of objects members offsets (in the internal object opaque structure) which caused misaligned pointer and lead to segfault depending on the members datatype

      - fixed OCI_BindArrayOfXXXX() documentation
      - fixed OCI_BindArraySetSize() when called many times with a new size > initial size
      - fixed endianness problem on big endian platforms when a string buffer had to be converted
      - fixed internal lengths used in implicit conversions in OCI_GetString() for some datatypes
