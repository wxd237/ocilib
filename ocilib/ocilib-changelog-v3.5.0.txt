2009-12-02 Version 3.5.0 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@gmail.com

    * Added support for Oracle warning (grace periode notication, SQL truncation, etc ...)

      - Added OCI_EnableWarnings()
      - Added OCI_ERR_WARNING
      - Updated documentation (page <modules> <error handling>)

    * New functions 

      - OCI_CollGetAt2()
      - OCI_SetUserPassword() to renew password

    * Native 64 bits fixes

      - Fixed Direct Path API
      - Added casts + modified some variables types

    * PL/SQL support fixes
      - Segmentation fault could happen when using OCI_Date binds in PL/SQL statements
      - Binds values for OCI_Date and big_int variable where not updated after OCI_Execute for PL/SQL
      - OCI_ServerGetOutput() : ouput was broken if statements PL/LSQL statmeent/blocks were re-executed
      - OCI_ServerGetOutput() : trash string was returned if the number of amonut of output lines was greater than the value of the  <arrsize> parameter of OCI_ServerEnableOutput()
       
    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - OCI_ImmediateFmt(), OCI_PrepareFmt(), OCI_ExecuteStmtFmt():  trailing character of formatted string representation of dates was missing on non windows plaftorms
      - OCI_ObjectGetColl() : the internal OCI Collection handle of the returned OCI_Coll object was invalid and thus caused segfault when calling OCI_Coll functions afterward for these objects
      - OCI_DateNextDay() : On unixes platforms+Unicode builds -> wrong value passed to the OCI internal call
      - OCI_Immediate() : if execution failed, internal OCI_Statement (and thus serveur cursor) was not deallocated 

    * Miscellaneous changes
    
      - OCI_RefToText() : parameter size is now if type <unsigned int> instead of <int>
      - Modified : OCI_BIND_MAX (maximum number of binds for a statement) is now 1024 by default instead of 512
      - Added Oracle spatial demo source (demo/geometry.c)
      - Now, OCI_API is by default set to __stdcall when using MS visual studio if it's not already defined
