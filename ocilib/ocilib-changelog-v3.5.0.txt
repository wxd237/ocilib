2009-12-21 Version 3.5.0 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@gmail.com

    * Added support for Oracle Database Change notification / Continuous Query Notification

      - Added type OCI_Subscription
      - Added OCI_SubscriptionRegister()
      - Added OCI_SubscriptionUnregister()
      - Added OCI_SubscriptionAddStatement()
      - Added OCI_SubscriptionGetName()
      - Added OCI_SubscriptionGetPort()
      - Added OCI_SubscriptionGetTimeout()
      
      - Added type OCI_Event
      - Added OCI_EventGetType()
      - Added OCI_EventGetOperation()
      - Added OCI_EventGetDatabase()
      - Added OCI_EventGetObject()
      - Added OCI_EventGetRowid()
      - Added OCI_EventGetSubscription()
      
      - Added new environment mode OCI_ENV_EVENTS to enable events
      - Updated documentation (new page <modules> <Database Change Notification>)

    * Added support for Oracle warning (grace period notification, SQL truncation, etc ...)

      - Added OCI_EnableWarnings()
      - Added error type OCI_ERR_WARNING
      - Updated documentation (page <modules> <error handling>)

    * New functions 

      - OCI_CollGetAt2()
      - OCI_SetUserPassword() to renew a user password (expired or active) 
      - OCI_SetErrorHandler() to modify user error handler callback after library initialization

    * Major Object API internal update, rewrite and improvement

      - Speed improvements
      - Now works on Unicode builds (tired to wait after Oracle fixes that never come, so i've reimplemented some buggy OCI calls)
      - Smarter code

    * Extended Lob Support

      - Added OCI_LobEnableBuffering()
      - Added OCI_LobGetChunkSize()
      
    * Native 64 bits fixes

      - Fixed Direct Path API
      - Added casts + modified some variables types

    * PL/SQL support fixes
      - Segmentation fault could happen when using OCI_Date binds in PL/SQL statements
      - Binds values for OCI_Date and big_int variable where not updated after OCI_Execute for PL/SQL
      - OCI_ServerGetOutput() : ouput was broken if PL/SQL statement/blocks were re-executed
      - OCI_ServerGetOutput() : trash string was returned if the number of amount of output lines was greater than the value of the  <arrsize> parameter of OCI_ServerEnableOutput()
       
    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - OCI_ImmediateFmt(), OCI_PrepareFmt(), OCI_ExecuteStmtFmt():  trailing character of formatted string representation of dates was missing on non windows platforms
      - OCI_ObjectGetColl() : the internal OCI Collection handle of the returned OCI_Coll object was invalid and thus caused segfault when calling OCI_Coll functions afterwards for these objects
      - OCI_DateNextDay() : On unixes platforms+Unicode builds -> wrong value passed to the OCI internal call
      - OCI_Immediate() : if execution failed, internal OCI_Statement (and thus server cursor) was not deallocated 
      - OCI_ConnectionFree() : removed internal call to object cache cleanup routine
      - OCI_DatabaseShutdown() : a segfault happened if the connection to the server could not be done 
      - fixed typos in OCILIB documentation (generated from OCILIB main header file: ocilib.h)

    * Miscellaneous changes
    
      - OCI_RefToText() : parameter size is now if type <unsigned int> instead of <int>
      - Modified : OCI_BIND_MAX (maximum number of binds for a statement) is now 1024 by default instead of 512
      - Added Oracle spatial demo source (demo/geometry.c)
      - Now, OCI_API is by default set to __stdcall when using MS visual studio if it's not already defined
      - If client version >= 11.1, OCILIB Resultsets allocate internal OCI descriptors array in one call (lobs, files, timestamp and interval)
 
    * Information : OCI_DatabaseStartup() fails on Unicode builds because OCI function OCIDBStartup() fails if OCI is initialized in UTF16 mode ! Another bug to report to Oracle !
