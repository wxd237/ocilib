    * Native 64 bits fixes

      - Fixed Direct Path API
      - Added casts + modified some variables types

    * PL/SQL support fixes
      - Segmentation fault could happen when using OCI_Date binds in PL/SQL statements
      - Binds values for OCI_Date and big_int variable where not updated after OCI_Execute for PL/SQL
      - OCI_ServerGetOutput() : ouput was broken if statements PL/LSQL statmeent/blocks were re-executed
      - OCI_ServerGetOutput() : trash string was returned if the number of amonut of output lines was greater than the value of the  <arrsize> parameter of OCI_ServerEnableOutput()
       
    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - OCI_ImmediateFmt(), OCI_PrepareFmt(), OCI_ExecuteStmtFmt():  trailing character of formatted string representation of dates was missing on non windows plaftorms

    * Miscellaneous  changes
    
      - OCI_RefToText() : parameter size is now if type <unsigned int> instead of <int>
      - Modified : OCI_BIND_MAX (maximum number of binds for a statement) is now 1024 by default instead of 512
