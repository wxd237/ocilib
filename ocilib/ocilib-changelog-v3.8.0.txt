      - Fixed internal array allocation when using OCI_ArraySetSize() called many times on the same prepared SQL statement
      - Fixed OCI_ElemGetTimeStamp() and OCI_ElemGetInterval() when collections are retreived from the server 
      - Fixed some API naming inconstancy (lower/upper case)

        - OCI_ObjectGetTimeStamp()    renamed to OCI_ObjectGetTimestamp()
        - OCI_TimestampSysTimeStamp() renamed to OCI_TimestampSysTimestamp()
        - Macros have been added for backward compatibility
        - Existing programs must be recompiled (in order to use this new version of ocilib) with no code change (as compatibility macros are provided)
