2009-07-28 Version 3.4.0 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@gmail.com

    * Added support for Oracle 11g remote instance management

      - Added OCI_DatabaseStartup()
      - Added OCI_DatabaseShutdown()
      - Added documentation (page <modules> <Remote Instance startup/shutdown>)

    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Fixed String binds: since v.3.3.0, an error ORA-01480 could happened if the string length was equal to the max size passed to OCI_BindString()
      - Fixed OCI_CollGetSize() that was returning wrong size after OCI_Execute() if the collection was binded as pure out variable or retrieved as a member of fetched OCI_Object handle
      - Fixed OCI_GetColumnNullable() : since v.3.0.0, it was always returning TRUE
      - Fixed internal binds buffer lenghts updates

    * Miscellaneous changes

      - Removed collection bounds / input index checking in OCI_CollGetAt() and OCI_CollSetAt()
      - Modified behaviour of OCI_BindGetDataSize() and OCI_BindSetDataSize() (see documentation or function declarations for more information)
      - Modified Oracle version handling:
        - Minor versions of OCI are now also detected at compile and runtime time
        - Versions constants have changed: 
          - before: 
            - OCI_8 (8), OCI_9 (9), OCI_10 (10), OCI_11 (11)
          - now : 
            - OCI_8_0  ( 800), OCI_8_1  ( 810)
            - OCI_9_0  ( 900), OCI_9_1  ( 920)
            - OCI_10_1 (1010), OCI_10_2 (1020)
            - OCI_11_1 (1110), OCI_11_2 (1120)
          - Compatibility macros were added to map old versions constant:
            - OCI_8 (=> OCI_8_0), OCI_9 (=> OCI_9_0), OCI_10 (=> OCI_10_1), OCI_11 (=> OCI_11_1)
          - All OCILIB functions returning single version number now returns the new version constants
          - Added macros to extract versions part numbers from new single version numbers:
            - OCI_VER_MAJ() : major    version
            - OCI_VER_MIN() : minor    version
            - OCI_VER_REV() : revision version
